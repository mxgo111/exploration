For exploring starts, we implemented Sutton-Barto's MC Exploring Starts on page 99

For epsilon-soft, we implemented Sutton-Barto's On-policy first-visit MC control on page 101

Currently, both appear to be working for FrozenLake, with both is_slippery=True or is_slippery=False
However, epsilon-soft seems to converge faster?
We implemented the incremental means version for both.

Observations:
- For FrozenLake and epsilon-soft, is_slippery=True, on some runs it seems to be
the case that the program takes a while before it obtains positive reward, but
this is a relatively uncommon occurrence.
