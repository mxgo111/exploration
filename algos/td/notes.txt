SARSA:
- modifying alpha changes the results by a LOT (increased from 0.1 ish at around 50000 iterations to 0.5 ish at around 50000 iterations with a simple adjustment)
- based on Sutton Barto page 130

Q-learning:
- based on Sutton Barto page 131
- increasing alpha a bit increased the results (more rigorous study needed)
